## Interface

VVim's interface is not based on menus or icons but on commands given in a text user interface; its GUI mode, **gVim**, adds menus and toolbars for commonly used commands but the full functionality is still expressed through its command line mode.

Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. 
Vim tends to allow a typist to keep their fingers on the home row, which can be an advantage for a touch typist.
Vim also has a built-in tutorial, manual and built-in help facility.

## Customization
Vim's power is that it can be extensively customized.  From personalized key mappings—often called macros— to color, look and type font. 
There are many plugins available that will extend or add new functionality to Vim. There are projects bundling together complex scripts and customizations and aimed at turning Vim into a tool for a specific task or adding a major flavour to its behavior. Examples include Cream, which makes Vim behave like a click-and-type editor, or VimOutliner, which provides a comfortable outliner for users of Unix-like systems.

#### Extra
- Vim is shipped with every copy of Apple macOS
- **How to exit Vim:**   :q \<enter\>
